## Implementation Details

### C Language Implementation
-  **Source Code**: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define ROW1 2  // Rows for Matrix A
#define COL1 3  // Columns for Matrix A
#define ROW2 3  // Rows for Matrix B
#define COL2 2  // Columns for Matrix B

void multiplyMatrices(int A[ROW1][COL1], int B[ROW2][COL2], int C[ROW1][COL2]) {
    // Perform matrix multiplication
    for (int i = 0; i < ROW1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < COL2; j++) {
            C[i][j] = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < COL1; k++) {
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
            }
        }
    }
}

void printMatrix(int matrix[ROW1][COL2], int rows, int cols) {
    // Print the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            printf("%d\t", matrix[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    int A[ROW1][COL1] = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6));
    int B[ROW2][COL2] = ((7, 8), (9, 10), (11, 12));
    int C[ROW1][COL2]; // Resultant Matrix

    // Multiply matrices
    multiplyMatrices(A, B, C);

    // Display Result
    printf("Matrix A:\n");
    printMatrix(A, ROW1, COL1);

    printf("\nMatrix B:\n");
    printMatrix(B, ROW2, COL2);

    printf("\nResultant Matrix (A × B):\n");
    printMatrix(C, ROW1, COL2);

    return 0;
}


-  **Compilation Command**:  ``gcc matrix.c -o matrix``

-   **Execution Command**:  ``./matrix``

### Python Language Implementation
-  **Source Code**:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define two matrixces
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]])

B = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10],[11, 12]])

# perform matrix multilication
C = np.dot(A, B)
# Display results
print("Matrix A:")
print (A)

print("\nMatrix B:")
print(B)

print("\nResultant Matrix C (A x B):")
print(C) 


```
-  **Execution Command**: Describe how to run the Python script.
Open Ubuntu terminal and run ``python3 matrix.py``

## Algorithm Verification
-  **Correctness**: Explain the methodology used to verify the correctness of the matrix multiplication algorithm.

**Answer**
- To ensure the correctness of the matrix multiplication algorithm, the following steps were taken:
**1. Theoretical Validation**
- Matrix multiplication follows a strict mathematical rule.
- The implementation must ensure that for two matrices A (m x p), the result C (m x p) follows this formula.

**2. Test Cases and Expected Results**
- We validate correctness by using known test cases where the expected results are pre-calculated:
- Example: Small matrix validation
- Given Matrices
- Expected Output
- Check if Algorithm Produces Same Output.

**3. Edge Case Testing**
- I test different edges to test robustness:
- 1. Identify Matrix: Any matrix multiplied by an identity matrix should return the original matrix.

- 2. Zero Matrix: Any matrix multiplied by zero matrix should return a zero matrix.

- 3. Different Dimensions: Ensure multiplication only happens if columns of A = rows of B.

-  4. Large Matrices: Run tests on large 100 x 100 matrices to check efficiency and precision.

**4. Debugging with Print Statements**
- Insert debug print statements to tract intermediate steps and verify the summation process for each element of C.

**5. Automated Testing with Assertions (For Python)**
- A function can run test cases and check if results match expected outputs.

**Summary**
- By verifying results with theory, test cases, debugging, edge case, and automation, we confirm correctness of the matrix multiplication algorithm.

-  **Analysis**: Discuss the performance differences observed and analyze the reasons behind them, considering factors like language execution models and memory management.

**Answer**
- Analysis of Performance Difference: 
-1. Compilation vs Interpretation
C is compiled (GCC converts it to machine code) → Runs directly on hardware → Faster.
Python is interpreted (bytecode runs in Python Virtual Machine) → Extra processing overhead → Slower.

- 2. Memory Management
C uses manual memory allocation (malloc/free) → Less overhead.
Python uses dynamic memory allocation (Garbage Collection) → Adds processing time.

- 3. NumPy Optimization
NumPy is fast because it uses C-based BLAS/LAPACK libraries for matrix operations.
For large matrices (500×500 and above), NumPy is close to C because it calls optimized C code internally.

- 4. Multi-threading & Parallelism
C can be explicitly optimized with OpenMP for parallel execution.
NumPy uses multi-threaded BLAS but has additional Python overhead.

**Summary**
Conclusion
For small matrices (<500×500): C is significantly faster due to lower overhead.
For large matrices (more than 1000×1000): Python (NumPy) gets closer to C performance because it uses optimized C-based libraries.
C is ideal for high-performance computing where fine-tuned memory control and parallelism are required.
Python (NumPy) is more user-friendly and easier for rapid prototyping, but has slight overhead due to interpretation.

- Used tools like gcc for C compilation and chmod for script execution.

**Markdown Documentation**
-Created structured project documentation using Markdown, including code formatting, tables, and headings.
-Used Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub repositories for project presentation.

**Programming Language Differences**
- C is faster than Python due to manual memory management and compilation into machine code.
- Python (NumPy) is easier to use and can achieve near-C performance for large matrices due to BLAS/LAPACK optimizations.
- C is preferred for performance-critical applications, while Python is more user-friendly for rapid prototyping.

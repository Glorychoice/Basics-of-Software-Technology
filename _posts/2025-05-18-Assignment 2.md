# My Report 
# Static Personal Website Summary
The objective of this project is to set up and deploy a static personal blog website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. 
I began by creating a new GitHub repository named Assignment-2, where I initialized a Jekyll site using the minima theme. I configured the _config.yml file to include details such as the site title, author, and description. Blog posts were added under the _posts directory, along with static pages like "About" and "Contact." Deployment was completed via GitHub Pages by enabling the feature in the repository settings. Throughout the project, I used Git for version control, making at least five meaningful commits to reflect major development stagesâ€”from initial setup to final content updates. The choice of GitHub Pages and Jekyll was due to their seamless integration and simplicity for static site deployment. The project helped me understand website configuration, deployment, effective use of Git, and documentation with Markdown.


## Tools used for the static site.
- GitHub Pages for static websites.

## Conclusion

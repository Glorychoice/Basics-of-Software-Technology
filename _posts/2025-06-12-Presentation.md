- Ameh Glory Ene-dugbo-ojo | LS2425231 | June 12 2025

# INRODUCTION
- This project evaluates GNSS signal performance using real-world BeiDou B3I data from a mobile receiver. It analyzes signal quality, satellite visibility, and positioning geometry. Key features include log-to-CSV conversion, SNR and DOP visualization, and skyplot/time-series analysis. An interactive GUI enables user-friendly control and results viewing.

# Development Environment
- Operating System: Windows 11 Home 64-bit Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU RAM: 16 GB Python Version: 3.10 (Anaconda) Environment: Glory (conda virtual environment) Libraries Used: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, tkinter AI Model Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4.5/o4

# GNSS Positioning Challanges
- GNSS accuracy is affected by satellite geometry, signal strength, and elevation. Obstructions and interference degrade performance significantly.

- Data collection process

# Result
-The results of the project demonstrate that the GNSS tool effectively parsed and analyzed BeiDou B3I data, generating clear visualizations such as skyplots, SNR graphs, and DOP curves. The satellite geometry analysis revealed how the Dilution of Precision (DOP) values varied over time, highlighting the impact of satellite distribution on positional accuracy. Overall, the tool provided valuable insights, confirming that selecting satellites with higher SNR and optimal geometry leads to more accurate and reliable GNSS positioning results.

# Conclusion
- The project successfully demonstrates how BeiDou B3I GNSS data can be parsed, visualized, and evaluated using an AI-assisted software development process. It provides a user-friendly tool for satellite geometry analysis and can be extended to include multi-constellation support and real-time monitoring. The use of large language models significantly accelerated development and debugging.

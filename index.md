## 🛰️ About This Page

This website was created as part of my Master's coursework at Beihang University to showcase assignments and project work related to **GNSS signal processing**, **AI-based navigation**, and **geospatial applications**. It demonstrates the integration of **Markdown**, **GitHub Pages**, and academic publishing principles for clear and organized technical content.

Feel free to explore the various assignments under the [Assignments](./) section.
